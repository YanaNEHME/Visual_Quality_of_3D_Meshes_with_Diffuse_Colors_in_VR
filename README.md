# Visual_Quality_of_3D_Meshes_with_Diffuse_Colors_in_VR
we provide a large dataset of 480 animated meshes with diffuse color information, and associated with perceived quality judgments. The stimuli were generated from 5 source models subjected to geometry and color distortions. Each stimulus was associated with 6 hypothetical rendering trajectories (HRTs): combinations of 3 viewpoints and 2 animations.These subjctive data allowed us to explore the influence of source models, animations and viewpoints on both the quality scores and their confidence intervals. - (IEEE TVCG paper, DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2020.3036153).
