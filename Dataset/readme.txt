		How to get the 3D Meshes with Diffuse Colors Database
**************************************************************************************

(1) Please download the dataset (1.2 GB .zip file) from the following link:
    https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/ynehme/datasets/Final_VertexColor_DB.zip

(2) Unzip (extract) files from the downloaded folder (Final_VertexColor_DB.zip).

(3) The downloaded folder contains:
- "readme.txt": provides a detailed description of the database and how it was generated.
- "Stimuli_Format_Obj": this folder encloses all the 3D graphic distorted stimuli, as well as their source models (references).
- "Stimuli_snapshots.zip": provides snapshots of all the stimuli in the database (references and distorted models), presented from their selected viewpoints.
- "Distortion_parameters": the parameters needed to replicate/regenerate the dataset.
- "All_Stimuli_MOS_and_MLE.csv": The subjective data obtained from our subjective experiment. 
   These data are used in the statistical analyses (section 4.3) of our paper entitled
   "Visual Quality of 3D Meshes with Diffuse Colors in Virtual Reality: Subjective and Objective Evaluation", and
   published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG, DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2020.3036153).
