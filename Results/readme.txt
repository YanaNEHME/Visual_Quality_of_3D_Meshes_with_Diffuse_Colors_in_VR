These figures are included in the section 4.3 (Factors that influence subjective opinions) of our paper entitled 
"Visual Quality of 3D Meshes with Diffuse Colors in Virtual Reality: Subjective and Objective Evaluation", and 
published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG, DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2020.3036153).

They refer to Fig.6, 7 and 8 in the paper. They were obtained by a quantitative/statistical analysis (provided in 
the Statistical_Analysis/Stistical_analysis.R) and summarize the most important results regarding the influence of 
source models, animations and viewpoints on both the subjetive quality scores and their confidence intervals.

(The aim is to replicate/regenerate these figures)
